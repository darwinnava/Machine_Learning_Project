 ## Overview
  - **Background**: Data from belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell accelerometers of 6 participants who performed dumbbell unilateral biceps curls were stored for the purpose of predicting execution quality. 
  - **Objectives**: Design and analysis of a machine learning model to predict unilateral dumbbell biceps curl execution quality.
  - **Methods**: An inference and prediction analysis in R. 
  - **Results**: 1. The random forest model accuracy: 0.9584.  2. Predictions on pml_testing data (out-of-sample error in a new dataset): (B A A A A E D B A A A C B A E E A B B B), Levels: A B C D E). 19 0f 20 predictions were correct.
  - **Conclusions**: 95% of the predictions were correct on the pml_testing dataset with the designed random forest model. The accuracy of the random forest is good. It showed high performance in predicting execution quality.

## Data processing


This project involves exploring the dataset that come from the project "Wearable Computing: Accelerometers' Data Classification of Body Postures and Movements" by Ugulino, W.; Cardador, D.; Vega, K.; Velloso, E.; Milidiu, R.; Fuks, H..
[Human Activity Recognition](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)

The training and testing data for this project are available here:  
[The training data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv)  
[The testing data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)  

It should be predicted the manner in which the 6 participants who performed dumbbell unilateral biceps curls did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.  

### An exploratory statistical analysis. Summary of the data.  
**Loading the training and test sets and displaying the internal structure.**  
This will allow establishing a strategy for answering the study question:  The Weight Lifting -  Are you doing your unilateral dumbbell biceps curl wrong?

**Data cleansing**  
**Handling Missing Values, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!", ""):**  
The total number of rows is 19622 in pml_training. The total sum of NAs in each of the eliminated columns is greater than 19200, representing at least 97.84% of missing values in each of them. The total number of rows is 20 in pml_testing. The total sum of NAs in each of the eliminated columns is 20, representing 100% of missing values in each of them.This allows removing 100 columns from our datasets.

## [1] "pml_testing dimension: 20 X 60"
```

```
## [1] "The code is available in the appendix."
```
**Handling Near Zero Variance,  participant idetification and  timestamps variables:**  
In pml_training all zeroVar results were FALSE except for the variable new_window. This variable will be removed. The variables raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2, cvtd_timestamp, num_window will be removed because they are used in a more specific type of prediction problem where data are dependent over time. The variables X and user_name will be removed too, in our case we seek to predict whether the weightlifting has been done correctly or not. This allows removing 7 columns from our datasets.

```

```
## [1] "pml_testing dimension: 20 X 53"
```

```
## [1] "The code is available in the appendix."
```
### An inference and prediction analysis 
**1. Find the right data and define your error rate**  
After the data cleansing, pml_training and pml_testing are going to be used.  

**2. Split data into: training,testing and Validation (Optional)**  
pml_training is a medium sample size. Validation is not going to be used.  

```
## [1] "training dimension: 14718 X 53"
```

```
## [1] "testing dimension: 4904 X 53"
```

```
## [1] "The code is available in the appendix."
```
**3. On the training set pick features, pick prediction functions and cross-validate.**  
Quantitatives variables highly correlated (>0.8) with each other are not useful to include them all in our model.  Processing covariants witn PCA-SVD can help to reduce predictors. Cross validation must be used in the model construction .The expected out-of-sample error should be reported.  
Then "Random forest, rf" is chosen. It has top performance along with boosting. Preprocessing with PCA and 5-fold Cross validation are going to be applied. The code is available in the appendix.

**The Random Forest Model**  
Preprocessing with PCA was doing previously. 5-fold Cross validation was set.  

```
## Random Forest 
## 
## 14718 samples
##    12 predictor
##     5 classes: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' 
## 
## No pre-processing
## Resampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold) 
## Summary of sample sizes: 11773, 11775, 11774, 11776, 11774 
## Resampling results across tuning parameters:
## 
##   mtry  Accuracy   Kappa    
##    2    0.9551575  0.9432688
##    7    0.9482269  0.9345018
##   12    0.9415690  0.9260773
## 
## Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
## The final value used for the model was mtry = 2.
```

**4. If no validation â€“ apply 1x to test set**  
Remember that the pm_training set was partitioned. 75% to train the "rf" model (training) and 25% to evaluate it (testing). pml_testing has not been touched up to this point.

**Observations:** Accuracy obtained: 0.9584  

## My prediction model predicting 20 different test cases, pml_testing set.  
what you think the expected out of sample error is?  
The expected out-of-sample error is greater than the in-sample error due to noise from a new dataset.
